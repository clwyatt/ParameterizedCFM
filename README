Simultaneous Optimization of Cost Function Masks and Registration Transforms

Most registration algorithms are cast as optimization problems. In
practice registration objectives often require cost function masks
(CFMs) to exclude regions of topological change in the image
levelsets caused by anatomical variation or pathology. The CFM must
be specified a-priori, usually from a manual or semi-manual
segmentation process. This project seeks an approach to
parameterization of CFMs using levelsets and thier optimization as
part of the registration process.
